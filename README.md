🧾 Overview

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on public comments related to **climate change** from **NASA’s official Facebook page** (2020–2023).  
Using **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**, comments are classified into three sentiment categories:
- 🟢 Positive  
- 🔴 Negative  
- ⚪ Neutral  

🎯 Objectives
- Analyze Facebook comments on climate change.  
- Determine public sentiment and engagement.  
- Visualize data using histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.  
- Train a machine learning model to predict sentiment from text.  

⚙️ Libraries Used
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- textblob  
- scikit-learn  

🧠 Model

* TF-IDF Vectorizer for feature extraction.
* Logistic Regression for classification.
* Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Data Science and NLP can analyze public opinions on global issues like climate change.
By leveraging textual data from social media, organizations like NASA can better understand public awareness, opinions, and emotional reactions, helping them improve climate communication strategies.
