🧾 Overview

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on public comments related to **climate change** from **NASA’s official Facebook page** (2020–2023).  
Using **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**, comments are classified into three sentiment categories:
- 🟢 Positive  
- 🔴 Negative  
- ⚪ Neutral  

🎯 Objectives
- Analyze Facebook comments on climate change.  
- Determine public sentiment and engagement.  
- Visualize data using histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.  
- Train a machine learning model to predict sentiment from text.  

⚙️ Libraries Used
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- textblob  
- scikit-learn  

🧠 Model

* TF-IDF Vectorizer for feature extraction.
* Logistic Regression for classification.
* Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
